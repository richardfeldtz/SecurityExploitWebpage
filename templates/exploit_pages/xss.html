    <h2>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
    <h5>What are they?</h5>
    <p>Cross-Site Scripting is when you allow the user to submit an input that will be executed as code. Your website would be vulnerable if the user input is
    directly located in the rendered pages. The users could submit, for example, malicious Javascript code that would then be executed when the page loads.</p>
    <p>Ways of stopping it include escaping all HTML-active characters in input and escaping data before putting it inside tags. </p>
    <p>In the example below, the good website is 'sanitizing' the input and stopping all scripts from being run in the HTML code input.</p>
    <h5>Example Time!</h5>
    <div ng-controller="xxsCtrl" class="form-group">
        <div>
            <textarea class="form-control" ng-model="code" row="12"></textarea>
            <label>How code is rendered: </label>
            <div ng-bind-html="trust()"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
