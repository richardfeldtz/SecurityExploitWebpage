    <h5>What is it?</h5>
    <p>
        Cross-Site Scripting is a type of attack enabled by allowing users to submit an input that will be executed as
        code by web browsers. A website is vulnerable if user input is directly located in the rendered pages. Users
        could submit, for example, malicious Javascript code that would then be executed when the page loads.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example below, the website is directly including the input in the rendered HTML code. Try experimenting
        with different forms of input!

    <h5>Example Time!</h5>
    <div ng-controller="xxsCtrl" class="form-group">
        <div>
            <textarea class="form-control" ng-model="code" row="12"></textarea>
            <label>How code is rendered: </label>
            <div ng-bind-html="trust()"></div>
        </div>
