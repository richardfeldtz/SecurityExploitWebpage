    <h2>Poorly Secured Passwords</h2>
    <h5>Why is it important?</h5>
    <p>
        Focusing on securely storing passwords might seem like a waste of time, as an untrusted party should never be
        able to access this information. However, by ensuring passwords are stored properly, you can minimize damage in
        the event of a security breach. Additionally, if the application holds sensitive information, it is good
        practice to ensure that even administrators maintaining the system do not have direct access to user passwords.
        Losing control of a user's account information can cause serious damage to your organization's reputation, and
        should be taken very seriously.

    <h5>Problems with common ways of storing passwords:</h5>
    <h6>Plaintext</h6>
    <p>
        The simplest (and least secure) way of storing passwords is storing them in plaintext. The passwords are
        stored just as they were entered by the user, and are checked for authentication by comparing them directly to
        the newly entered password.<br>If an attacker were to gain access to the system where the passwords are stored,
        they could take the passwords and use them as-is to access user accounts. Even worse, because users often reuse
        passwords between websites, the attacker could compromise the user's other accounts and cause even more damage.
    </p>
    <h6>Hashing</h6>
    <p>
        Another method of storing passwords is to use them as inputs to a cryptographic hashing function and store the
        result. Hashes are one-way functions, so once the password has been hashed, there is no easy way of returning it
        to its previous form. To authenticate users, the submitted password is put through the hashing algorithm and the
        result is compared to the stored hash value.<br>If an attacker were to gain access to the list of hashed
        passwords, they couldn't use them directly. Putting a hashed value through the hash function again would yield a
        different value. However, because there are a limited number of hashing algorithms in use and users often pick
        common passwords, an attacker could use a so-called "Rainbow Table" attack. This involves pre-computing a large
        table of common password hashes and comparing these values to the ones in your system. If the attacker can find
        a match, then they will know what that user's password is.
