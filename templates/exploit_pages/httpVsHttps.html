    <h2>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h2>
    <h5>What is the difference?</h5>
    <p>
        HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it provides the foundation for communication on the Internet.
        It allows for data transfer between a client like a web browser and a server, and allows users to view web pages.
        HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure and consists of communication done using HTTP on a secure
        encrypted connection using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or sometimes referred to as Secure Sockets Layer
        (SSL). HTTPS uses this protocol to encrypt data requests between clients and web servers where regular HTTP does
        not encrypt data transfers.

        Below is an example of a HTTP request where a user is accessing their account information. The user's username
        and password are passed as parameters in the URL, as well as their credit card number in the HTTP request header.
        This information is transferred in plaintext since we are using HTTP.

        http://example.com/?username=bob&password=GoBucks123

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Date: Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:26:47 GMT
        ...
        Set-Cookie: creditCardNumber=12345678912345

        This is obviously not an optimal way to preserve your user's data confidentiality in your website, you would
        definitely not want to pass the user's credit card number in plaintext (don't worry this ones fake). A hacker
        could gain access to this data by a man-in-the-middle attack and viewing the HTTP request. Check out the link
        below to see why using HTTPS in your website is beneficial to data confidentiality.
