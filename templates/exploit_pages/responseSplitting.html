    <h2>HTTP Response Splitting</h2>
    <h5>What is it?</h5>
    <p>
        HTTP Response Splitting is an exploit that hijacks HTTP responses to perform other attacks.<br>The exploit
        works by forcing an HTTP response from the application to include carriage return (\r) and line feed (\n)
        characters in the response header. This is accomplished by injecting data with these characters into the
        application.
    </p>
    <h5>How does it work?</h5>
    <p>
        To show how the exploit works, consider the code example below.
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        String user = request.getParameter(USER_PARAM);
        ...
        Cookie cookie = new Cookie("user", user);
        cookie.setMaxAge(cookieExpiration);
        response.addCookie(cookie);
        ...
    </p>
    <p>
        In the above example, the user parameter will be included in the response header. If the user parameter is a
        normal string of alphanumeric characters, then this won't be a problem. However, if an attacker was able to
        create a user entry with the name "Hackerman\r\nContent-Length:999\r\n\r\n&lthtml&gt(1337 hacks...)&lt/html&gt",
        then the HTTP response would look something like this:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        ...
        Set-Cookie: user=Hackerman
        Content-Length:999

        &lthtml&gt(1337 hacks...)&lt/html&gt
        ...
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows the attacker to take complete control of the response. They can even create new responses, thereby
        splitting the response. These responses can be used to perform attacks on other users of the site or carry out
        website hijacking, among other things.
