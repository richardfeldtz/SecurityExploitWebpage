    <h2>HTTP Parameter Pollution</h2>
    <h5>What is it?</h5>
    <p>HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) is an exploit that takes advantage of the way different technologies handle
        parameters in HTTP requests.</p>
    <p>Normally, an HTTP request will have certain parameters that the application is expecting. These parameter
        values are usually scanned by a web application firewall to prevent attacks like code injection.</p>
    <p>However, if the request contains multiple entries of the same parameter, the behavior of different server
        is inconsistent. Take a look at the example below:</p>
    <p class="code">http://example.com/?user_mode=guest&search_string=apples&number_results=50</p>
    <p>In the example above, the request has 3 parameters: user_mode, search_string, and number_results. Each parameter
        has a matching value. However, what if the request was modified to look like this:</p>
    <p class="code">http://example.com/?user_mode=guest&search_string=apples&number_results=50&search_string=oranges</p>
    <p>Now, the search_string parameter appears twice. What should the application do? Some implementations will only
        use the last occurrence of the parameter, while others will concatenate all of the values together. Other
        behaviors exist as well.</p>
    <p>This becomes a security issue when the behavior of the application is different than the behavior of the firewall
        that is scanning the inputs. For example, the firewall might be scanning inputs to prevent SQL injection. So the
        phrase "drop table x" might be filtered out. But consider the request below:</p>
    <p class="code">http://example.com/?search_string=drop&number_results=50&search_string=table x</p>
    <p>In this case, it is possible that the web application firewall might scan each parameter individually, and not
        see anything suspicious. But if the application later concatenates the parameter values, the harmful string
        would be reassembled and potentially pose a security threat.</p>
    <p>HTTP Parameter Pollution, while not dangerous by itself, can serve as a vehicle for other forms of attack, like
        code injection.</p>
